<h1><Strong>REAL TIME ENVIRONMENTAL STATICS USING C</Strong></h1><br>
This repo will contain all the Future implementations of Our Environmental Analysis Using C language. <br>
- The data will be collected from a get request to an API, and certain fields of them will be stored in a FIlE.<br>
- The data will be shown to the user, as desired.<br>
- The Program should generate alerts to the User if there is an anomaly/abnormality in the Processed Data.<br>
- All these things will be implemented on the Linux System, and will be accessed by the user through commands.<br>
<br>
Documentations and User-guide will be provided, later in the development process.
