<Strong>REAL TIME ENVIRONMENTAL STATICS USING C</Strong><br>
This repo will contain all the Future implementations of Our Environmental Analysis Using C language. 
- The data will be collected from a get request to an API, and certain fields of them will be stored in a FIlE.
- The data will be shown to the user, as desired.
- The Program should generate alerts to the User if there is an anomaly/abnormality in the Processed Data.
- All these things will be implemented on the Linux System, and will be accessed by the user through commands.
